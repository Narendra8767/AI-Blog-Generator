# AI-Blog-Generator<br>
AI Blog Generator that creates full-length, high-quality blogs from just a topic â€” powered by the incredible combo of LangGraph, LangChain, and OpenAI!<br>

What I Built<br>
Given a topic like "How AI is Transforming Healthcare", the app:<br>

ðŸŸ¦ Generates a clean outline<br>
ðŸŸ¦ Produces a detailed blog post based on the outline<br>
ðŸŸ¦ Assigns a quality score (0â€“10) using LLM-based evaluation<br>



Tech Stack: LangGraph + LangChain + Flask + OpenAI + Python<br>

ðŸ’¡ How It Works:<br>
Using LangGraph, I designed a clear and controlled stateful workflow:<br>
ðŸ”¹ create_outline â†’ generates a structured outline<br>
ðŸ”¹ create_blog â†’ writes detailed content based on the outline<br>
ðŸ”¹ evaluate_blog â†’ scores the quality of the blog (0â€“10)<br>

LangGraph handles these stages using nodes (functions) and edges (execution order) to form a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). This makes the entire flow modular, explainable, and maintainable.<br>

ðŸ“š Learning Outcomes:<br>
âœ… Understood how LangGraph simplifies complex multi-step LLM tasks using a graph-based paradigm.<br>
âœ… Learned to build and connect nodes, and direct the flow using edges (START â†’ Outline â†’ Blog â†’ Evaluation â†’ END).<br>
âœ… Gained clarity on understanding and designing sequential workflows, which is key when orchestrating step-by-step AI pipelines.<br>
âœ… Learned how to separate logic into clean, traceable units â€” essential for building scalable and maintainable agentic AI workflows.<br>


ðŸ§  Why LangGraph?<br>
LangGraph offers a powerful way to design AI workflows as graph-based systems, where each step (node) performs a specific task and flows are explicitly defined.<br>

It helped me:<br>

âœ… Model multi-step logic clearly with nodes like outline â†’ blog â†’ evaluation<br>
âœ… Maintain shared state across steps, ensuring data consistency<br>
âœ… Build modular, reusable components for each phase of the blog generation process<br>
âœ… Visualize and control flow, making it easy to extend or debug<br>
âœ… Scale the system easily by adding new logic nodes (like SEO scoring or language translation)<br>

LangGraph allowed me to build an AI application thatâ€™s not only smart â€” but structured, traceable, and production-ready.<br>
